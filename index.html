            <h2>Why Seller Financing Works for Homeowners</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Seller financing offers unique advantages that traditional home sales can't match. Here's why it's becoming the preferred choice for smart homeowners looking to sell:</p>
            
            <div class="benefits-grid">
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <div class="benefit-icon">📈</div>
                    <h3>Earn Steady Income</h3>
                    <p>Receive monthly payments with interest, creating a reliable income stream. You earn more over time than a one-time cash sale, while still getting a down payment upfront.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <div class="benefit-icon">💰</div>
                    <h3>Command Higher Prices</h3>
                    <p>Attract motivated buyers who value the flexibility and speed of seller financing. These buyers are often willing to pay a premium for the convenience, and seller financing often justifies a 5-10% higher sale price.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <div class="benefit-icon">⚡</div>
                    <h3>Sell Faster</h3>
                    <p>Close deals in days or weeks instead of months. Skip the lengthy bank approval process and enjoy a streamlined closing. Your property sells when you're ready, on your timeline.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <div class="benefit-icon">📋</div>
                    <h3>Tax Advantages</h3>
                    <p>Spread capital gains over multiple years, potentially reducing your tax burden. Interest income may be taxed at a lower rate than a lump-sum sale.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <div class="benefit-icon">🎯</div>
                    <h3>Attract More Buyers</h3>
                    <p>Expand your buyer pool significantly. Many qualified buyers prefer seller financing for its speed, flexibility, and better terms. Seller financing opens your property to a wider range of motivated buyers.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <div class="benefit-icon">🔒</div>
                    <h3>More Control Over the Sale</h3>
                    <p>Set your own terms, interest rates, and payment schedules. You decide who buys your property and under what conditions, without bank restrictions.</p>

            <h2>How Seller Financing Works</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Seller financing is simpler than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide to how the process works:</p>
            
            <div class="steps-container">
                <div class="step-item">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>You set the terms (not the bank)</h3>
                        <p>You and the buyer agree on the purchase price, down payment, interest rate, monthly payment, and how long the loan lasts (often with a 5–10 year balloon).</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>You transfer ownership at closing</h3>
                        <p>The buyer gets the deed at closing (just like a normal sale). You are protected by a mortgage or deed of trust recorded against the property.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>You become the lender</h3>
                        <p>Instead of getting all cash up front, you receive the down payment now and monthly payments from the buyer, including interest.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>You're secured if something goes wrong</h3>
                        <p>If the buyer stops paying, the agreement includes a deed in lieu of foreclosure clause, so they simply transfer the deed back to you without going through the foreclosure process. The property secures your loan, making it a safe investment.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>You get paid off later (balloon or refinance)</h3>
                        <p>At the agreed time (often 5–7 years), the buyer refinances or sells and pays you the remaining balance in full.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Walk through real numbers</li>
